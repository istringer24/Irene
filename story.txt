Once upon a time there lived a princess named Natalia. She lived in a far away land that was very isolated. She loved her village, but she longed to travel and experience the outside world.

Natalia decided one day that she would subscribe to Pewdiepie. Thus, she joined the battle to defeat T-series.

After a month, she got bored. She made up her mind to expeience the world by playing League of Legends. She kept practicing her skills days and nights, and finally she became a Challenger.

She later on represented her country to win the championship in the worldwide League of Legends competition. She gained huge fame and wealth, and eventually returned to her village. She spent the money on the village, and everyone was grateful for her.

As a gesture of how greatful they were, her village built a statue in her name. She felt that she had now experienced the world and she then live happily ever after in her beloved village.
