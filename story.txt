Once upon a time there lived a princess named Natalia. She lived in a far away land that was very isolated. She loved her village, but she longed to travel and experience the outside world.

Natalia decided one day that she would subscribe to Pewdiepie. Thus, she joined the battle to defeat T-series.

After a month, she got bored. She made up her mind to expeience the world by playing League of Legends. She kept practicing her skills days and nights, and finally she became a Challenger.
